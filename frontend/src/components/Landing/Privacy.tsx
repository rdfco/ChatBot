              enabled, we collect error information through Sentry to improve

              providers like Sentry only to the extent necessary for error
              reporting and resolution. This helps us improve our support and
              services. If users configure a third-party integration (e.g.
              LangSmith tracing), we may also share information with those
              services.

              necessary to protect our rights or the rights of others. Very
              little information is stored however, given the fact that STIM
